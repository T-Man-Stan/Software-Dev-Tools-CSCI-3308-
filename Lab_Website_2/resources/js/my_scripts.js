					 To handle this, you will need to iterate through the players array
					 and do the following for each player:
						1. Create an anchor tag
						2. Set the href to "#", this will make sure the 
							anchor tag doesn't change pages
						3. Set the onclick to call switchPlayers method 
							(this will need to pass in the index inside the players array)
						4. Set the anchor tag's text to the player's name.
						
					After setting all of the anchor tags, update the innerHTML of the dropdown menu.
					As a note, the id for the dropdown menu is player_selector.
